# Traits-Function
Synthesis and meta-analysis of traits and functional ecology.

It allows users to analyze traits (e.g. social traits) and their responses to environmental factors, as another way of exploring biodiversity. 
It provides tools to clean (make sure you really want to do this) and organize data, test for phylogenetic signal, inpute data using phylogenetic distances/models and other methods, run multivariate analysis, and create some nice plots of functional groups or trait variations.
